<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Variables </title>

		<p>
			In this section, we will discuss the two types of variables that appear in differential equations: dependent and independent variables. We will also explore how to identify these variables in a differential equation and understand their roles in the context of solving differential equations.
		</p>

		<p>
			Recall from the previous sections, the solution to a differential equation such as
			<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 3x^2,
			</men>
			is some function, <m>y(x)</m>. This means that every differential equation inherently involves two variables: one representing the solution (i.e., <m>y</m>) and one representing the variable that the function depends on (i.e., <m>x</m>). Therefore, it is very important to understand the roles of these types of variables when working with differential equations.
		</p>

		<dl>
			<li><title> Dependent Variable </title>
				<p>
					The dependent variable is the function we are trying to find. It represents the <em>solution</em> to the differential equation. It is the <m>y</m> variable in equation <xref ref="variables-de-1"/>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><title> Independent Variable </title>
				<p>
					The independent variable is the variable on which the function depends. It's the input of the function and the <m>x</m> variable in equation <xref ref="variables-de-1"/>.
				</p>
			</li>

	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> \frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>\frac{dP}{ds}</m> appears in the equation and is also the derivative of <m>P</m> with respect to <m>s</m>, the equation implies that <m>P</m> is a function of <m>s</m>. Therefore, the dependent variable is <m>P</m> and the independent variable is <m>s</m>. Moreover, the solution to this differential equation is the dependent variable, <m>P</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>

	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> u'' + t^2 \ u = 0 </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>\frac{dP}{ds}</m> appears in the equation and is also the derivative of <m>P</m> with respect to <m>s</m>, the equation implies that <m>P</m> is a function of <m>s</m>. Therefore, the dependent variable is <m>P</m> and the independent variable is <m>s</m>. Moreover, the solution to this differential equation is the dependent variable, <m>P</m>.

		</solution>
	
	</example>

	<p>
		For the moment, consider the differential equation 
		<men xml:id="variables-eqn1">
			x\frac{dy}{dx} - 2y = 4 - x.
		</men>
		This differential equation has two variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. One of these variables represents the solution (a function) and the other represents the values that you plug into the function. In differential equations, it is important to know which one is which. For our example, <m>y</m>, is the solution and <m>x</m> represents the values we plug into <m>y</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		It turns out that <m>y(x) = x^2 + x - 2</m> is a solution to <xref ref="variables-eqn1"/> above. 
		<fn>
			The notation, <m>y(x)</m>, is used to indicate that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. However, we often drop the "<m>(x)</m>" to shorten the expression
		</fn>
		Let's graph this function by selecting <m>x</m>-values to input into the function giving us some <m>y</m>-values, as shown below.

		We graphed this function to emphasize the fact that the <m>y</m>-values could not be found until we had the <m>x</m>-values. In other words, the <m>y</m>-values were <em>dependent</em> on the <m>x</m>-values and the <m>x</m>-values were choosen <em>independently</em> from any other value.

			<li>The independent variable may or not be present in a differential equation, but a dependent variable must be present.</li>
			<li>If a variable has a derivative applied to it, it must be the dependent variable. The other variable present is the independent variable. </li>
			<li>When we solve a differential equation, the dependent variable is the solution and it will be written as a function of the independent variable. </li>
			<li>In general, if you were plotting a solution to a differential equation, the independent variable would correspond to the <m>x</m>-axis (horizontal) and the dependent variable would correspond to the <m>y</m>-axis (vertical). </li>

		Let's look at a few examples to demonstrate how we identify the dependent and independent variables contained in a differential equation.
