<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xml:id="sec-general-solutions"><title> What is a Solution? </title>

  <introduction>

    <p>
		Regardless what kind of equation you are working with, a solution is a value or function that <q>satisfies</q> the equation. The term <em>satisfies</em> simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, you get something that is undeniably true. If you get something false, instead, then that value is not a solution.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		For example, consider the equation 
		<me>
			y^3 = 3y + 2 
		</me>.
		Are <m>y = 2</m> and <m>y = 0</m> solutions? To check, we plug both <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> into every <m>y</m> in the equation and see if we get something that is undeniably true.

				<md>
					<mrow> (2)^3 	=\amp\ 3(2) + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 6 + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 8	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
				</md>

			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> (0)^3 	=\amp\ 3(0) + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 0 + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 2	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		Since <m>y=2</m> satisfies the equation and <m>y=0</m> does not, we say that <m>y=2</m> is a solution to the equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Verifying whether something is a solution to a differential equation is very similar. The only difference is that solutions are functions instead of numbers. if the function <em>satifies</em> the equation, then it is a solution. Otherwise, it is not. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, consider the differential equation 
		<me>
			y^\prime = 3y
		</me>.
		Are <m>y = 3x</m> and <m>y = e^{3x}</m> solutions? To check, we plug both <m>3x</m> and <m>e^{3x}</m> into every <m>y</m> in the equation and see if we get something that is undeniably true.
		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[3x\right]^\prime 	=\amp\ 3(3x)								</mrow>
					<mrow> 3 		=\amp\ 9x	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[e^{3x}\right]^\prime 	=\amp\ 3e^{3x}								</mrow>
					<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot \left[3x\right]^\prime		=\amp\ 3e^{3x}								</mrow>
					<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot 3		=\amp\ 3e^{3x}	</mrow>
					<mrow> 3e^{3x}		=\amp\ 3e^{3x}	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		Since <m>y=e^{3x}</m> satisfies the equation and <m>y=3x</m> does not, we say that <m>y=e^{3x}</m> is a solution to the equation.
	</p>

	
	<example xml:id="calculus-pov"><title> A Calculus Perspective </title>
			
		<p>
			Suppose you were given <m> y(t) = 4t^3 + \sin t </m>, and asked to find <m>y''</m>.
		</p>
	
		<p/>
	
		<p>
			Since we are familiar with calculus, we quickly take two derivatives of <m>y</m>, giving
			<md>
				<mrow> y' 	\amp= 12t^2	+ \cos t		</mrow>
				<mrow> y'' 	\amp= 24t 	- \sin t.		</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			This task is no problem for us, but suppose we started with
			<me> y'' = 24t 	- \sin t	</me>
			and were asked to go in the reverse direction. That is, find a function, <m>y(t)</m>, that has <m>24t - \sin t</m> as a second derivative. <em> This is precisely what solving a differential equation aims to do and we would phrase this problem as, </em>
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="80%" halign="center" valign="bottom">
			<p>
				"given the differential equation, <m> y'' = 24t 	- \sin t</m>, solve for <m>y.</m>"
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		
		</example>
	
		<example xml:id="physics-pov"><title> A Physics Perspective </title>
		<p>
			Let <m>y(t)</m> be the position of some object at time, <m>t</m>.  Assume for the moment that we don't know what <m>y</m> is, but we do know the object is moving with a constant velocity of <m>4.6</m> meters per second.
		</p>  
			
		<p>
			Physics tells us that velocity is the rate of change of position (i.e., derivative of position, <m>y'(t)</m>). So, given that the object is moving at a known constant velocity, we may write
			<me> y'(t) = 4.6. </me>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			This is another example of a differential equation where one could ask "what function, <m>y(t)</m>, has a derivative that is equal to <m>4.6</m>?"
		</p>
	
		</example>
	
		<p> 
			The situations above illustrate simple examples of what a differential differential equation is and what it means to "solve" a differential equation. Throughout this text, we will present many more examples and discuss various techniques used to solve them.
