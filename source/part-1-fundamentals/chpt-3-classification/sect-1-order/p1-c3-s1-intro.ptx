		One of the primary ways we classify differential equations is by their order. Just as knowing the genre helps you locate a book in the library, understanding the order of a differential equation helps you determine the appropriate techniques for solving it.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-order">
		<statement>
			<p>
				The <term>order</term> of a differential equation is the highest <term>order</term> derivative that appears in the equation.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the highest derivative in an equation is the first derivative, we say the differential equation has <em>first-order</em>. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, we say it has <em>second-order</em>, and so on.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Knowing the order of a differential equation helps us understand its complexity and the types of solutions we can expect. It's like knowing the difficulty level of a hike before you start, so you can prepare accordingly.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="example-order-1">
		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad \DS \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x.</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			This DE has order 1 (<em> the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a first derivative</em>) and is called a "first-order differential equation".
		</p>

		</solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-order-3">
		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad x^2y'' + y''' = \sin x + y^8 .</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			This DE has order 3 (<em> the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a third derivative</em>) and is called a "third-order differential equation".
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Note</em>: Be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. The <m>y^8</m> term just indicates that the dependent variable raised to the 8th power; this has nothing to do with the order of the DE.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-order-2">
		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad \DS \frac{d^2A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17 .</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Since the highest derivative is a second derivative, we say this is a second-order DE. <em> Notice that in this notation, the exponent is used to indicate the second derivative. </em>
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		We've seen two different notations to indicate the derivative here. The prime notation is quite common, but it becomes unwieldy for higher-order derivatives such as <m>y'''''''</m>. We could use the fractional notation <m>\frac{d^7y}{dx^7}</m>, but this is also a bit cumbersome. Therefore, for derivatives of order greater than three, the convention will be to write the order of the derivative in parentheses. For example, the 7th derivative of <m>y</m> is written as <m>y^{(7)}</m>. <em>Be careful not to confuse this notation with raising <m>y</m> to the 7th power.</em>
