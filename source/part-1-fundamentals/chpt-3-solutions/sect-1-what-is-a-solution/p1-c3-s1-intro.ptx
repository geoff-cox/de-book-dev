  <introduction>

    <p>
			Let's consider two more examples to illustrate the concept of a differential equation and what it means to "solve" a differential equation.
		</p>


		<example xml:id="calculus-pov"><title> A Calculus Perspective </title>
			
		<p>
			Suppose you were given <m> y(t) = 4t^3 + \sin t </m>, and asked to find <m>y''</m>.
		</p>
	
		<p/>
	
		<p>
			Since we are familiar with calculus, we quickly take two derivatives of <m>y</m>, giving
			<md>
				<mrow> y' 	\amp= 12t^2	+ \cos t		</mrow>
				<mrow> y'' 	\amp= 24t 	- \sin t.		</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			This task is no problem for us, but suppose we started with
			<me> y'' = 24t 	- \sin t	</me>
			and were asked to go in the reverse direction. That is, find a function, <m>y(t)</m>, that has <m>24t - \sin t</m> as a second derivative. <em> This is precisely what solving a differential equation aims to do and we would phrase this problem as, </em>
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="80%" halign="center" valign="bottom">
			<p>
				"given the differential equation, <m> y'' = 24t 	- \sin t</m>, solve for <m>y.</m>"
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		
		</example>
	
		<example xml:id="physics-pov"><title> A Physics Perspective </title>
		<p>
			Let <m>y(t)</m> be the position of some object at time, <m>t</m>.  Assume for the moment that we don't know what <m>y</m> is, but we do know the object is moving with a constant velocity of <m>4.6</m> meters per second.
		</p>  
			
		<p>
			Physics tells us that velocity is the rate of change of position (i.e., derivative of position, <m>y'(t)</m>). So, given that the object is moving at a known constant velocity, we may write
			<me> y'(t) = 4.6. </me>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			This is another example of a differential equation where one could ask "what function, <m>y(t)</m>, has a derivative that is equal to <m>4.6</m>?"
		</p>
	
		</example>
	
		<p> 
			The situations above illustrate simple examples of what a differential differential equation is and what it means to "solve" a differential equation. Throughout this text, we will present many more examples and discuss various techniques used to solve them.
