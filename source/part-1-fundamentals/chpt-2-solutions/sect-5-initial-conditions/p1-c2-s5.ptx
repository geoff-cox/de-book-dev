<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Initial Conditions </title>

	<p>
		When you <q>solve</q> a differential equation, you're actually computing the general solution, which means you have a variety of possible solutions (a family) that differ by at least one constant. However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since many differential equations have solutions that depend on time, the term <term>initial condition</term> refers to any starting information you have about the solution. A differential equation that includes at least one initial condition is called an <term>initial-valued problem (IVP)</term>. It's reasonable to have some initial information about the solution, as the next example illustrates.
	</p>

	<example><title>Real World Initial Conditions</title>
		<p>
			An introductory physics problem is the free fall of an object due to gravity. Let <m>s(t)</m> be the position (distance from the ground) of this object at time <m>t</m>. Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, we get the DE
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<me>
				\text{acceleration of object} \rightarrow \quad s''(t) = -32 \text{ ft/s}^2.
			</me>
			Assuming the ball is dropped from the top of a 100 ft building, what initial information do you know? That is, what are the initial conditions?
		</p>

		<answer>
			<p>
				You know the starting position and starting velocity of the ball. That is, you have the initial conditions
				<me>
					s(0) = 100 \text{ ft} \quad \text{and} \quad s'(0) = 0 \text{ ft/s}.
				</me>
			</p>
		</answer>

		<p>
			For most of the techniques in this book, solving an initial value problem requires two main steps:
			<ol marker="1.">
				<li>
					Solve for the general solution (with constants).
				</li>
				<li>
					Compute the constants in the general solution using the initial conditions.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	
	<p>
		In this section and in the exercises that follow, we will be only concerned with step 2. So don't worry if you do not understand where these general solutions come from. In chapter 2, we will look at our first technique for solving a differential equation.
