	<p>
		In this section, we will discuss the two types of variables that appear in differential equations: dependent and independent variables. We will also explore how to identify these variables in a differential equation and understand their roles in the context of solving differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall from the previous sections, the solution to a differential equation such as
		<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 3x^2,
		</men>
		is some function, <m>y(x)</m>. This means that every differential equation inherently involves two variables: one representing the solution (i.e., <m>y</m>) and one representing the variable that the function depends on (i.e., <m>x</m>). All variables in a differential equation fall into one of the following two categories:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<li xml:id="dependent-variable"><title> Dependent Variable </title>
			<p>
				The dependent variable is the <m>y</m> variable in <xref ref="variables-de-1"/>. It represents the function we are trying to find (i.e., the <em>solution</em>).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li xml:id="independent-variable"><title> Independent Variable </title>
			<p>
				The independent variable is the <m>x</m> variable in <xref ref="variables-de-1"/>. The solution is a function of the independent variable.
			</p>
		</li>
	</dl>

	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> \frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>\frac{dP}{ds}</m> appears in this equation, it is implied that
				<ul>
					<li>
						<m>P</m> is a function that depends on <m>s</m> and must be the <em>dependent variable</em>,
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>s</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>, and
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>P(s)</m> represents the <em>solution</em> to this differential equation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</solution>
	
	</example>
	
	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
	
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> u'' + t^2 \ u = 0 </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>u''</m> appears in this equation, it is implied that
				<ul>
					<li>
						<m>u</m> is a function that depends on <m>t</m> and must be the <em>dependent variable</em>,
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>t</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>, and
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>u(t)</m> represents the <em>solution</em> to this differential equation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
	
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> Q'' = 11Q </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>Q''</m> appears in this equation, we know that <m>Q</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>, but there is no sign of an independent variable. Typically the context of the problem will tell us the independent variable. Otherwise, we are free to select our own independent variable, say <m>t</m>. Now we can say that <m>Q(t)</m> would be the <em>solution</em>.
