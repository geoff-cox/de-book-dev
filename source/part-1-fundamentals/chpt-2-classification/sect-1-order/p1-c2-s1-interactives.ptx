			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad \DS \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x.</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			This DE has order 1 (<em> the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a first derivative</em>) and is called a "first-order differential equation".

		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad x^2y'' + y''' = \sin x + y^8 .</m>

		<solution>
		<p>
			This DE has order 3 (<em> the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a third derivative</em>) and is called a "third-order differential equation".
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Note</em>: Be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. The <m>y^8</m> term just indicates that the dependent variable raised to the 8th power; this has nothing to do with the order of the DE.

	<example xml:id="example-order-2">
		<p>
		Give the order of the differential equation,
		<m>\quad \DS \frac{d^2A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17 .</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Since the highest derivative is a second derivative, we say this is a second-order DE. <em> Notice that in this notation, the exponent is used to indicate the second derivative. </em>
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		We've seen two different notations to indicate the derivative here. The prime notation is quite common, but if one wants to indicate the 8th derivative, using <m>y''''''''</m> seems quite absurd. We could write <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^8y}{dx^8}</m>, but the fractional notation is also somewhat cumbersome. So for orders of derivatives greater than three, we replace the primes with the number of derivatives in parentheses. That is, the 8th derivative of <m>y</m> would be written as <m>\DS y^{(8)}</m>.
