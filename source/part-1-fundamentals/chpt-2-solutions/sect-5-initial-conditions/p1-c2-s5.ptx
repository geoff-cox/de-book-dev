	<p>
		When you <q>solve</q> a differential equation, you're actually computing the general solution, which means you have a variety of possible solutions (a family) that differ by at least one constant. However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.
