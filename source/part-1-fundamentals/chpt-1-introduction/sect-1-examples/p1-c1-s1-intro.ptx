<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> What is a Differential Equation? </title>

	<p>
		When leanring a new concept, it is typically a good strategy to compare it to things that you already know. To understand what a differential equation is, it makes sense to show how it differs from stadard equations that you are familiar with. For example, suppose we wanted to solve for <m>y</m> in the following three equations
		<me>
			y + 3 = 7, \quad y + 3x = 7, \quad y^\prime + 3x = 7.
		</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		All three are equations, but only the third equation is a <em>differential equation</em> since it contains the derivative, <m>y^\prime</m>. Nevertheless, each of these equations seek to solve for <m>y</m> by isolating it on one side of the equation. Let's look at what happens in each case.
		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y + 3	\amp= 7	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y 		\amp= 4	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y + 3x	\amp= 7			</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y 		\amp= 7 - 3x	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y^\prime + 3x	\amp= 7			</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y^\prime		\amp= 7 - 3x	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
	</p>

	<p>
		The solutions to first and second equations could be found, but the third equation does not have a solution yet since we only found <m>y^\prime</m>, not <m>y</m>. Later, we will see how to <q>remove</q> the derivative to isolate <m>y</m> completely. Also, notice that the solution to the first equation is a number, while the solution to the second equation is a function of <m>x</m>. <em>Differential equations will always have functions as solutions.</em>
	</p>

	<p>
		Many times, a quantity is connected to how it changes (its derivative). When these connections are expressed mathematically, they result in a differential equation. For example, consider this statement:
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>The rate of change of a function is equal to the function itself.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</p>

	<p>
		Mathematically, if we give this function a name, say <m>y</m>, this statement can be transformed into a differential equation, as shown.
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>The <m>\color{blue}\underset{y^\prime}{\fbox{rate of change of a function}}</m> <m>\underset{=}{\fbox{is equal}}</m> to the <m>\color{green}\underset{y}{\fbox{function}}</m> itself.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<me> y' = y. </me>
	</p>

	<p>
		A <q>solution</q> to this differential equation would be any function equal to its own derivative. Do you know a function like that?
		<fn>Since <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^x\right] = e^x</m> then <m>y=e^x</m> is a solution!</fn>  
	</p>

	<p>
		Here is another example from physics: 
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>A force acting on an object is equal to the object's mass (constant) multiplied by its acceleration.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</p>

	<p>
		If we let <m>F(t)</m> be the force on the object, <m>y(t)</m> be the position of the object, and remembering that acceleration is the second derivative of position, then this statement can be written as the differential equation
		<me> F(t) = mass \cdot y''(t) </me>.
		The solution to this differential equation would involve finding the position function <m>y(t)</m>.
