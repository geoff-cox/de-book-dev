  <p>
    In practice, differential equations are often paired with some information about the solution itself. For example, suppose we want to come up with a differential equation that predicts the spread of a disease in some community. The solution of this DE would be a function that predicts the number of people infected (output) for some given time (input) in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two quantities at play here: the number infected = <m>I</m>, and time = <m>t</m>.  For this discussion, let's assume time is in days.
  </p>

  <question>
    <title>What are the dependent and independent variable in this case?</title>
    Since the number of infected, <m>I</m>, changes according to how much time, <m>t</m>, has	passed, then <m>I</m> depends on <m>t</m>. Therefore, <m>I</m> would the dependent variable and <m>t</m> would be the	independent variable.
  </question>

  <p>
    Note, we don't know anything about the differential equation, but we know the solution will be
    <me>I(t) = \text{some function of } t</me>.
    Once this solution is known, we can use it to predict the number infected at a future time.  Now, let's say we have the solution, <m>I</m>, plug <m>t=10</m>	into it, and see the following:
    <me> I(10) = 30. </me>
    This result would be interpreted as "after 10 days, we predict 30 people will be infected".
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember, we don't know the differential equation nor the solution, but based on the situation, we should know some information.
  </p>

  <question>
    <title>What is one value for the number of infected we should know?</title>

    <p>
      Since we can count the number currently infected, we should know the exact number of people initially infected. So we should get this initial value when we plug time = 0 into our solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the ease of discussion, let's say the initial number of infected was 12. This means we	know
      <me>I(0) = 12</me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any information about the initial value of a dependent variable is referred to as an <term> initial condition. </term>
    </p>

  </question>

  <definition xml:id="def-initial-condition">
    <statement>
      An <term>initial condition</term> for a differential equation is any known value of the dependent variable at a known value of the independent variable. That is, if <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>x</m> is the independent variable, then an initial condition would be
      <me>y(\text{known value of } x) = \text{known value of } y \text{ at } x.</me>
      Any differential equation that includes at least one initial condition is called an <term>initial valued problem (IVP)</term>.
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="example-initial-conditions-01">

    <p>
      The differential equation,
      <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x, </me>
      is not an initial value problem because it does not include a value of <m>y</m> at some <m>x</m> value.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast, the differential equation,
      <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x, \hspace{0.25cm} y(5) = -10. </me>
      is an initial value problem because it includes the initial value <m>y(5) = -10</m>.

        To prepare you for this discussion, let's review a few important points
        of the previous section that will be useful in this section.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The general solution of a differential equation contains a certain number of constants.
            <!-- Remove footnote for now
            <fn>
              <p>
              Typically, the number of constants in the general solution equals the order of the differential equation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is illustrated in <xref ref="sect-01-03-02-ex-05" /> since
              <m>y'' - y' - 12y = 0</m> is of 2nd order and the general solution,
              <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m>, has 2 constants,	<m>c_1</m> and
              <m>c_2</m>.
              </p>
            </fn>
            -->
          </li>
          <li>
            All different combinations of these constants give you the collection of	possible solutions we called a family of solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific values for the constants produces a particular solution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    
      <!--
      <remark xml:id="sect-01-04-01-remark-01">
        <p>
          Typically, the number of constants present in the general solution is
          equal to the order of the differential equation<m>^{1}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is illustrated in <xref ref="sect-01-03-02-ex-05" /> since
          <m>y'' - y' - 12y = 0</m> is of 2nd order and the general solution,
          <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m>, has 2 constants,	<m>c_1</m> and
          <m>c_2</m>.
        </p>
      </remark>

        <title>Solving Initial Value Problems</title>
        <p>
          For most of the techniques in this book, solving an initial value problem requires two main steps:
          <ol marker="1.">
            <li>
              Solve for the general solution (with constants).
            </li>
            <li>
              Compute the constants in the general solution using the initial conditions.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </assemblage>
    
      <p>
        In this section and in the exercises that follow, we will be only concerned with step 2. So don't worry if you do not understand where these general solutions come from. In chapter 2, we will look at our first technique for solving a differential equation.
      </p>
    
      <exercise>
    
        <statement>
          <p>
            Referring to the 2nd bullet point above, if you use initial conditions to find the constants of the general solution, then we can reasonably state that
            <sidebyside width="90%">
              <p>
                Initial conditions find a <m>\UL{\phantom{particular solution}}</m> from the general solution (or family of solutions).
              </p>
            </sidebyside>
          </p>
        </statement>
    
        <answer> particular solution </answer>
    
      </exercise>
    
      <p>
        Let's have a look at a few examples.
      </p>
    
      <example xml:id="example-solution-constants-01">
    
        <p>
          Solve	<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x, \hspace{0.25cm} y(0) = 0. </me>
        </p>
    
        <solution>
    
          <p>
            Note, this is the same DE as in <xref ref="example-de-solution-01" />, except, we have just added an initial condition.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The first part is done since we already know the general solution is
            <me>\DS y = Ce^{x^2} + 3.</me>
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Next, we apply the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m>, to find <m> c_{1}</m>.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Since this condition can be	read, "when <m>x = 0,</m> then <m>y = 0.</m>",
            we substitute these values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> into our general
            solution, and solve for <m> c_{1}</m>.
    
            <md>
              <mrow> y \amp=  c_{1}e^{x^2} + 3	\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 0	\amp=  c_{1}e^{0^2} + 3</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp				\amp						 0	\amp=  c_{1} + 3</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp				\amp						-3	\amp=  c_{1}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Hence, the when add this initial condition to the DE, you get the
            particular solution, <m>y = -3e^{x^2} + 3.</m> among the family of
            solutions.  See below for a visual demostration of how a particular
            solution can change for different initial conditions.

        <solution>
    
          <p>
            The general solution to this DE was already found in <xref ref="example-de-solution-03" /> to be
            <me>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</me>.
            Notice that two initial conditions are provided in this example. This extra piece of information is needed since our general solution contains two constants.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Since one initial condition involves the derivative, we will need to compute this before applying this condition.
            <me>y' = -3c_1e^{-3t} + 4c_2e^{4t}.</me>
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Now let's apply the initial conditions:
            <md>
              <mrow>y(0)	\amp= 4		\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 	4
                \amp= c_1e^{-3\cdot 0} + c_2e^{4\cdot 0}</mrow>
              <mrow>			\amp	\amp	4
                \amp= c_1 + c_2		</mrow>
              <mrow>			\amp	\amp	\amp	</mrow>
              <mrow>y'(0)	\amp= -5	\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 	-5
                \amp=-3c_1e^{-3\cdot} + 4c_2e^{4\cdot}	</mrow>
              <mrow>			\amp	\amp	-5	\amp= -3c_1 + 4c_2	</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
    
          <p>
            We now have two equations and two unknowns,
            <md>
              <mrow>	 c_1 +  c_2	\amp=	4 	</mrow>
              <mrow> -3c_1 + 4c_2	\amp= -5 	</mrow>
            </md>
            There are multiple ways to solve this system of equations, and the reader is encouraged to verify that	<m>c_1 = 3</m> and <m>c_2 = 1</m>. Here is one
    
            <solution>
    
              We will solve for <m>c_2</m> in the first equation and then
              substitute into the second.
              <md>
                <mrow>4					\amp= c_1 + c_2										</mrow>
                <mrow>\Rightarrow c_2	\amp= 4 - c_1								</mrow>
                <mrow>					\amp															</mrow>
                <mrow>-5				\amp= -3c_1 + 4c_2								</mrow>
                <mrow>\Rightarrow -5	\amp= -3c_1 + 4(4 - c_1)		</mrow>
                <mrow>-5				\amp= -3c_1 + 16 - 4c_1						</mrow>

            </solution>
    
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Thus, the solution we that satisfies the DE and both of the provided initial conditions is	<me> y = 3e^{-3t} + e^{4t}. </me>
          </p>
    
        </solution>
    
      </example>
    
      <p>
        You've now seen a couple of examples that demonstrate how we can use extra information to narrow exactly one solution from the infinite number we have in the general solution. Keep in mind that, ordinarily, we would use a solution technique to find the general solution. Since we haven't covered any solution techniques yet, we are just asking find a particular solution from the general solution in the exercises below.
