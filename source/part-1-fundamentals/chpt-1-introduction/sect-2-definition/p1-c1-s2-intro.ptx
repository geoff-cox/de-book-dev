		Now that we understand what differential equations are and have seen a few examples, let's look at the definition.  
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-de"><title>Differential Equation</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A <term>differential equation (DE)</term> is an equation that contains one or more derivatives of some unknown function. When this unknown function has only one variable, we call the DE an <term>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</term>. Otherwise, it is called a <term>partial differential equation (PDE)</term>.
				<fn>
					<term>Notation</term>. Since this text only focuses on ordinary differential equations, the short-hand <term>DE</term> will always imply ODE.
				</fn>
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		The definition states that a differential equation should contain at least one derivative (e.g., <m>f^\prime</m>, <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>). Moreover, since it is also an "equation", so must also contain an "<m>=</m>" sign. This allows us to identify each of the following as a differential equation:

		<me>
			\underset{\text{derivative and = sign}}{\underbrace{{\color{blue}\frac{dy}{dx}} \ + 1 \ {\color{blue} =} \ y}}, \hspace{1cm}
			\underset{\text{derivative and = sign}}{\underbrace{{\color{blue} f^{\prime\prime}} \ + x^2 + 3x \ {\color{blue} =} \ 19}}, \hspace{1cm}
			\underset{\text{derivative and = sign}}{\underbrace{e^t \ {\color{blue} =} \ \tan(\ {\color{blue} y^\prime} \ )}}.
		</me>
	
		In contrast, none of the following is a differential equation:
	
		<me>
			\underset{\text{no = sign}}{\underbrace{\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}}}, \hspace{1cm}
			\underset{\text{no derivative}}{\underbrace{x^2 + 3x = 19}}, \hspace{1cm}
			\underset{\text{no derivative}}{\underbrace{\sin y + e^x = 0}}
		</me>
