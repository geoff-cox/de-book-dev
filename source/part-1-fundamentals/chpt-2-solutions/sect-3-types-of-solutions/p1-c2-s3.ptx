	<introduction>
		<p>
			At this point, you should comfortable with the idea that <em> a solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies it </em>. You have also seen that <xref ref="de-two-solutions" text="custom"> a single differential equation can have more than one solution </xref>. However, this begs the question: 
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<em><q>How many solutions does a differential equation have?</q></em>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			The answer depends on the context of the problem and is the focus of this section. To kick-off this discussion, lets start with an example.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<note><title>EDIT</title>
		<p>
			CHANGE THIS EXAMPLE SO THAT THE FUNCTION IS THE GENERAL SOLUTION.
		</p>
	</note>

	<example xml:id="verification-with-a-constant"><title> <em>Solution Verification with a Constant</em> </title>
		<p>
			Show that the functions 
		</p>
		<me>y = e^{2x},\ \ y = 2e^{2x},\ \ y = 3e^{2x},\ \ y = -7e^{2x},\ \ y = 0.3e^{2x},\ \ y = \pi e^{2x} </me> 
		are solutions to the differential equation
		<m>\quad y''' - 4y' = 0</m>.
		<solution>
			
			<p>
				You could verify all of these functions one-by-one, but you will quickly find the process repetitive since each function has the pattern
				<me>y = (\text{some number})\ e^{2x} \quad \text{or} \quad y = c\ e^{2x} </me>
				where <m>c</m> could be any of the numbers, <m>1, 2, 3, -7, 0.3, \pi </m>, above . 
			</p>

			<p>
				<xref ref="solution-verification-step-2" text="title"/>. Find <m>y'</m> and <m>y'''</m> since they appears in the DE.
				<md>
					<mrow>	y		\amp=  c e^{2x}						</mrow>
					<mrow>	y'		\amp=  c e^{2x}\cdot(2) = 2c e^{2x}	</mrow>
					<mrow>	y''		\amp=  2c e^{2x}\cdot(2) = 4c e^{2x}	</mrow>
					<mrow>	y'''	\amp=  4c e^{2x}\cdot(2) = 8c e^{2x}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				<xref ref="solution-verification-step-3" text="title"/>. Plug <m>y'</m> and <m>y'''</m> into the DE and simplify.
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y''' - 4y'	\amp= 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	8c e^{2x} - 4(2c e^{2x})	\amp= 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	8c e^{2x} - 8c e^{2x}	\amp= 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	0	\amp= 0	</mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution to <m>y''' - 4y' = 0</m> where <m>c</m> is any constant.
			</p>

			<remark><title> <em>Before moving on ...</em> </title>
				<p>
					<em>Convince yourself that if you replace <m>c</m> with any number in the process above, you will still get <m>0 = 0</m> in the end!</em>
				</p>
			</remark>

		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		As you can see from the example above, the function <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> satisfies the differential equation <m>y''' - 4y' = 0</m> for <em>ANY</em> possible value of <m>c</m>. 
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em><q>How many choices for <m>c</m> are there?</q></em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		Of course, the answer is infinitely many! This means that <m>y''' - 4y' = 0</m> has an infinite number of solutions. In most cases, as long as a differential equation has at least one solution, it also has infinitely many.
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, when discussing the solutions to a differential equation, it is helpful to introduce the following terminology.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="types-of-solutions"><title> Types of Solutions </title>
	
		<statement>
			<dl>
				<li xml:id="family-of-solutions">
					<title>Family of Solutions</title>
					<p>
						The collection of all possible solutions of a DE.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="general-solution">
					<title>General Solution</title>
					<p>
						The common form	of the solutions in the family.
						<fn>
							By "form", we mean the common pattern (up to constants) that all solutions share.
						</fn>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="particular-solution">
					<title>Particular Solution</title>
					<p>
						A single solution in the family.
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<note><title>EDIT</title>
		<p>
			NEED TO FIX THE BULLETS BELOW. THE FUNCTION IS NOT THE GENERAL SOLUTION.
		</p>
	</note>
	<p>
		Applying these terms to the previous example, we can state the following:
		<ul>
			<li> 	<m>\displaystyle y = c e^{2x}</m> is the <em>general solution</em> of <m>y''' - 4y' = 0</m>. </li>
			<li> 	<m>y = 2e^{2x}</m> is a <em>particular solution</em> in the <em>family of solutions</em> of <m>y''' - 4y' = 0</m>. </li>
			<li> 	Solutions in the <em>family of solutions</em> of <m>y''' - 4y' = 0</m> look like <m>y = c e^{2x}</m>. </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
				
	<example><title> <em>Solution Verification</em> </title>
		<p>
			Verify that <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2</m> is a solution to <m>\quad y'' = 1</m>.
		</p>
	
		<solution>

			<p>
				<xref ref="solution-verification-step-1" text="title"/>: <m>\quad y'' - 1 = 0</m>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				<xref ref="solution-verification-step-2" text="title"/>. Find <m>y''</m> since it appears in the DE.
				<md>
					<mrow>	y	\amp=  \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2									</mrow>
					<mrow>	y' 	\amp=  x + c_1													</mrow>
					<mrow>	y'' \amp=  1														</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<xref ref="solution-verification-step-3" text="title"/>. Plug <m>y''</m> into the DE and simplify.
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y'' - 1	\amp= 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	1 - 1	\amp= 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 		0	\amp= 0	</mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2</m> is a solution to <m>y'' = 1</m>.
