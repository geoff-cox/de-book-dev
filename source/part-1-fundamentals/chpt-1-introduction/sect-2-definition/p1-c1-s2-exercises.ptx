      <statement>
        True or False: A differential equation is an equation that involves one or more integrals of an unknown function.
      </statement>
      <answer>
        False. A differential equation is an equation that involves one or more <em>derivatives</em> of an unknown function, not integrals.

      <statement>
        <p>
        True or False: An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) contains derivatives with respect to more than one variable.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
        False. An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) only contains derivatives with respect to one variable. If it contains derivatives with respect to more than one variable, it is known as a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).
