  "title": "What is a Differential Equation?",
  "body": "What is a Differential Equation?  When many students think of an equation, they typically visualize an algebraic equation, where you attempt to isolate the unknown using a series of algebraic rules. In contrast, a differential equation also aims to isolate an unknown, but in this case, the unknown is a function rather than a number. Another notable aspect of differential equations is that they involve derivatives.  Many times, a quantity is connected to how it changes (its derivative). When these connections are expressed mathematically, they result in a differential equation. For example, consider this statement:   The rate of change of a function is equal to the function itself.     Mathematically, if we give this function a name, say , this statement can be transformed into a differential equation, as shown.   The  to the itself.      A solution to this differential equation would be any function equal to its own derivative. Do you know a function like that? Since then is a solution!   Here is another example from physics:   A force acting on an object is equal to the object's mass (constant) multiplied by its acceleration.     If we let be the force on the object, be the position of the object, and remembering that acceleration is the second derivative of position, then this statement can be written as the differential equation . The solution to this differential equation would involve finding the position function .  Test your Understanding   DE Solution 1   In general, a solution to a differential equation is a      constant    It is possible for a solution to be a constant, but not in general.      function    Yes, when you solve a differential equation, you get a function.      number    It is possible for a solution to be a number, but not in general.      limit    Sorry, no.

This indicates that velocity is constant.           Incorrect. This indicates that velocity is a constant times acceleration.           Incorrect. This indicates that acceleration is a constant times position.           Correct. The acceleration is equal to a constant times the velocity.

Correct. The rate of cooling is equal to a constant times the temperature difference.           Incorrect. This represents a second derivative relationship.           Incorrect. This does not represent the rate of change.           Incorrect. This implies the rate of change is directly proportional to the temperature, not the temperature difference.      "

  "body": "Variables  In this section, we will discuss the two types of variables that appear in differential equations: dependent and independent variables. We will also explore how to identify these variables in a differential equation and understand their roles in the context of solving differential equations.  Recall from the previous sections, the solution to a differential equation such as is some function, . This means that every differential equation inherently involves two variables: one representing the solution (i.e., ) and one representing the variable that the function depends on (i.e., ). Therefore, it is very important to understand the roles of these types of variables when working with differential equations.   Dependent Variable  The dependent variable is the function we are trying to find. It represents the solution to the differential equation. It is the variable in equation .   Independent Variable  The independent variable is the variable on which the function depends. It's the input of the function and the variable in equation .    Test your Understanding   Match the Variables   Identify the dependent and independent variables of the following DE:      Dependent Variable     Independent Variable     Identify the dependent and independent variables of the following DE:    Since is the variable that has a derivative applied to it, it must be the dependent variable.  We also know the following:  The other variable, , must be the independent variable.   represents the solution to this differential equation.  The solution, , will be a function of .      Now you Try  The dependent variable of , , is        The dependent variable has derivatives applied to it.         Yes! The term indicates that must be the dependent variable since it is the variable that has a derivative applied to it.      Identify the dependent and independent variables of the following DEs:    The first equation has dependent variable and independent variable .  The second has dependent variable and independent variable .  The dependent variable is , but we are not able to determine the independent variable without more information about what the DE represents.      Identify the Variables   Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation , and state which variable represents the solution.   Since appears in the equation and is also the derivative of with respect to , the equation implies that is a function of . Therefore, the dependent variable is and the independent variable is . Moreover, the solution to this differential equation is the dependent variable, .     Identify the Variables   Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation , and state which variable represents the solution.   Since appears in the equation and is also the derivative of with respect to , the equation implies that is a function of . Therefore, the dependent variable is and the independent variable is . Moreover, the solution to this differential equation is the dependent variable, .    For the moment, consider the differential equation This differential equation has two variables, and . One of these variables represents the solution (a function) and the other represents the values that you plug into the function. In differential equations, it is important to know which one is which. For our example, , is the solution and represents the values we plug into .  It turns out that is a solution to above. The notation, , is used to indicate that is a function of . However, we often drop the \" \" to shorten the expression Let's graph this function by selecting -values to input into the function giving us some -values, as shown below.      List some   values  first            -3 3    -2 -1    -1 -3    -0 -3    1 -1    2 3       The values  are dependent   on the values         We graphed this function to emphasize the fact that the -values could not be found until we had the -values. In other words, the -values were dependent on the -values and the -values were choosen independently from any other value.  Dependent and Independent Variables   In a differential equation, the dependent variable is the variable that represents the unknown function (i.e., solution). The independent variable represents the variable that the unknown function depends on.    Useful Facts about Variables   The independent variable may or not be present in a differential equation, but a dependent variable must be present.  If a variable has a derivative applied to it, it must be the dependent variable. The other variable present is the independent variable.  When we solve a differential equation, the dependent variable is the solution and it will be written as a function of the independent variable.  In general, if you were plotting a solution to a differential equation, the independent variable would correspond to the -axis (horizontal) and the dependent variable would correspond to the -axis (vertical).    Let's look at a few examples to demonstrate how we identify the dependent and independent variables contained in a differential equation.  "

In this text, you will encounter many different methods for solving differential equations. The method that you apply will be based on some aspect or property of a differential equation. So, it makes sense to separate differential equations into groups that have properties in common. This grouping process is known as classification and it will be one of the first things we consider before discussing a new technique for solving a differential equation.  You actually have experience with classification already. Try to answer the following question:     Click on the equations below that can be solved using the quadratic formula.                       The functions of and must be separated by multiplication, not addition.    This section explores one of the most common ways to group differential equations by simply observing the highest derivative present in the equation.   The order of a differential equation is the highest order derivative that appears in the equation.   Simply put, it's an indicator of the equation's complexity and provides insight into the nature of the solutions one might expect.  A first-order differential equation contains only first derivatives. These equations often model steady, linear rates of change, and are comparatively straightforward to solve and understand.  Second-order differential equations introduce second derivatives into the mix. With this added complexity, these equations are capable of describing a broader range of phenomena, including oscillations and vibrations.  As the order increases, so does the complexity and the richness of the phenomena that the equations can describe. Higher-order equations may require more sophisticated techniques for their solution, as they often represent more intricate and dynamic systems in the real world.  In sum, the order of a differential equation is a crucial initial piece of information that informs us about the equation's structure and the potential strategies we might employ to find its solutions. Understanding the order is an essential first step in working effectively with differential equations.  This section discusses some of the common ways to separate differential equations into groups that have similar properties. There are various reasons for why one would want to classify DEs, and each reason can lead to different groupings of DEs. In this text, DEs are grouped by the technique required to solve them.  To clarify this idea, let's consider an analogous situation that has nothing to do with differential equations. Consider the two equations below.   How might you go about solving the first equation for ? One option might be to factor the left-side of the equation and set each factor equal zero. Another option would be to use the quadratic formula.  Now consider the second equation. Would it be appropriate to use the quadratic formula to solve it? The quadratic formula is great, but it doesn't apply to every equation. When we solve any algebraic equation, we need to make sure the technique we apply is appropriate.  The same is true for differential equations. We will study several different techniques for solving DEs, each of which is the appropriate method for solving a certain type of DE. Thus, the goal of this section is to understand how to classify DEs so that later we'll know what solution methods are appropriate for its type.   Test your Understanding   Give the order of the differential equation,    This DE has order 1 ( the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a first derivative ) and is called a \"first-order differential equation\".     Give the order of the differential equation,    This DE has order 3 ( the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a third derivative ) and is called a \"third-order differential equation\".   Note : Be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. The term just indicates that the dependent variable raised to the 8th power; this has nothing to do with the order of the DE.    Now you Try The order of the differential equation, , is   No, Try again.    No, Try again.     Yes! The term with the most derivatives applied to it is .     No, Try again.     Give the order of the differential equation,    Since the highest derivative is a second derivative, we say this is a second-order DE. Notice that in this notation, the exponent is used to indicate the second derivative.     We've seen two different notations to indicate the derivative here. The prime notation is quite common, but if one wants to indicate the 8th derivative, using seems quite absurd. We could write , but the fractional notation is also somewhat cumbersome. So for orders of derivatives greater than three, we replace the primes with the number of derivatives in parentheses. That is, the 8th derivative of would be written as .

A differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written as    This definition is intended to represent the form of all possible linear differential equations, so it may seem a bit overwhelming. It may be easier to understand linearity based on what it is not, rather than what it is. So, let's begin by describing characteristics of a DE that make it nonlinear.   Identifying a nonlinear DE  A differential equation is nonlinear if any of the following are true about the dependent variable and\/or its derivatives:    Has a power other than 1.     Example:    is nonlinear because the dependent variable, , is raised to the second power.     Is inside another function.    Example:   is nonlinear since the derivative, , is inside a logarithmic function.     Are multiplied together.    Example:   is nonlinear since the first term is a product of and .

Greg Comment: I like the idea of showing what a linear equation is not . Can we do more to say what it is?
