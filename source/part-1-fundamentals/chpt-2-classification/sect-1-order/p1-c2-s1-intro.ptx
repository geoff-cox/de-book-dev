		In this text, you will encounter many different methods for solving differential equations. The method that you apply will be based on some aspect or property of a differential equation. So, it makes sense to separate differential equations into groups that have properties in common. This grouping process is known as <em>classification</em> and it will be one of the first things we consider before discussing a new technique for solving a differential equation.

		You actually have experience with classification already. Try to answer the following question:

		This section explores one of the most common ways to group differential equations by simply observing the highest derivative present in the equation.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-order">
		<statement>
			The <term>order</term> of a differential equation is the highest <term>order</term> derivative that appears in the equation.
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Simply put, it's an indicator of the equation's complexity and provides insight into the nature of the solutions one might expect.
	</p>

	<p> 
		A first-order differential equation contains only first derivatives. These equations often model steady, linear rates of change, and are comparatively straightforward to solve and understand.
	</p>

	<p> 
		Second-order differential equations introduce second derivatives into the mix. With this added complexity, these equations are capable of describing a broader range of phenomena, including oscillations and vibrations.
	</p>

	<p> 
		As the order increases, so does the complexity and the richness of the phenomena that the equations can describe. Higher-order equations may require more sophisticated techniques for their solution, as they often represent more intricate and dynamic systems in the real world.
	</p>

	<p> 
		In sum, the order of a differential equation is a crucial initial piece of information that informs us about the equation's structure and the potential strategies we might employ to find its solutions. Understanding the order is an essential first step in working effectively with differential equations.

		This section discusses some of the common ways to separate differential	equations into groups that have similar properties. There are various reasons for why one would want to classify DEs, and each reason can lead to different groupings of DEs. In this text, DEs are grouped by the technique required to solve them.
	</p>

	<p>
		To clarify this idea, let's consider an analogous	situation that has nothing to do with differential equations. Consider the two equations below.
		<me> x^2 - 7x  - 6 = 0 \hspace{1cm} e^{4x} = 2^{7x-8} </me>
	</p>

	<p>
		How might you go about solving the first equation for <m>x</m>?  One option might be to factor the left-side of the equation and set each factor equal zero.  Another option would be to use the quadratic formula.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now consider the second equation.  Would it be appropriate to use the quadratic formula to solve it? The quadratic formula is great, but it doesn't apply to every equation. When we solve any algebraic equation, we need to make sure the technique we apply is appropriate.
	</p>

	<p>
		The same is true for differential equations. We will study several different techniques for solving DEs, each of which is the appropriate method for solving a certain type of DE. Thus, the goal of this section is to understand how to classify DEs so that later we'll know what solution methods are appropriate for its type.
